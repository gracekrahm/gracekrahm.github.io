Hello! I am a first-year Astronomy PhD student at The Ohio State University. My research is generally focused on interstellar medium and how it relates to galaxy structure and star formation. I am currently working with Adam Leroy on characterizing the vertical structure of the edge-on galaxy NGC 4565. A more detailed description of my current and past projects can be found in the Research tab. 

I recently graduated from Agnes Scott with a B.S. In Astrophysics, as well as minors in Mathematics and Dance. Outside of academics I enjoy dancing, knitting, biking, and reading fantasy novels.
