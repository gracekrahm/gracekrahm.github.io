I am a third-year Astrophysics major at Agnes Scott College with minors in Mathematics and Dance. My research focuses on star formation and the interstellar medium. I also enjoy tutoring other students and helping out at Agnes Scott's Bradley Observatory. Outside of academics I enjoy dancing, knitting, and reading fantasy novels.
