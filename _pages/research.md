## Molecular Clouds in the Merging Antennae Galaxies  
<sup> <i>Advisor:  Molly Finn and Remy Indebetouw <br> National Radio Astronomy Observatory REU Program </i> </sup>  
The Antennae galaxies is a pair of merging galaxies that has formed thousands of super star clusters (SSCs). Using ALMA observations of CO I identified and characterized the molecular clouds in the overlap region between the two galaxies. I found that the molecular clouds are very dense and require extremely hiigh external pressures to remain gravitationally bound due to their high amount of turbulence. This is consistent with other large galaxies with high star formation rates, as well as molecular clouds at the centers of galaxies, regardless of their star formation rates. Comparing the Antennae molecular clouds to SSC-forming dwarf galaxies also suggests that the physical properties needed to form SSCs in dwarf galaxies are significantly different to massive galaxies.   

The results of this work were presented at the 241st AAS meeting on Tuesday, January 10th. The iPoster can be viewed in the AAS [iPoster gallery](http://aas241-aas.ipostersessions.com/Default.aspx?s=38-DC-32-1C-F6-51-68-1C-6D-76-36-E6-2A-79-C1-CC).

## Determining Radial Velocities of Young Star Clusters   
<sup> <i>Advisor:  Alexandra Yep <br> Agnes Scott College </i> </sup>   
How stars and star clusters are moving throughout the sky can tell us a lot about their star formation histories. Using the 0.9 m SARA (Southeastern Association for
Research in Astronomy) telescope at Kitt Peak (SARA-KP) and its fiber-fed echelle spectrograph, I observed numerous stars in the open cluster NGC 2244. Using the redshift of the stars, I was able to estimate the radial velocity of the star cluster. Combining this radial velocity calculation with proper motion data from Gaia allows for the calculation of the total motion of the star cluster.

## New Constraints on the Dimensions of a Theoretical Perfect Cuboid   
<sup> <i>Advisor:  Alan Koch <br> Agnes Scott College STEM Scholars Program</i> </sup>   
For several hundred years, mathmaticians have been trying to prove the existance of a perfect cuboid: a box-like shape with integer side and diagonal lengths. Using modular arithmetic, I was able to place additional constraints on the side lengths a perfect must have is such an object does exist. I also determined the minimum volume of a cuboid to be a multiple of 12,640,320.

## HR Diagrams and Ages of Globular Clusters  
<sup> <i>Advisor:  Amy Lovell <br> Agnes Scott College</i> </sup>   
Globular clusters are among the oldest objects in the universe with some being over 13 billion years old. Using the 1m Jacobus Kapteyn SARA Telescope at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in La Palma, I obtained detailed photometric data from the M53 and M79 globular clusters. After constructing Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagrams of the star clusters, I was able to use isochrones to determine the ages of each of the globular clusters to be close to 12 billion years old.
